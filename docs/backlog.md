# Backlog

Ideas for later. Not planned yet, just written down so they don't get lost.

## Over The Hare, over the USB cable

On the Brick, Over The Hare moves files to the device over Wi-Fi. The Pixel 2
has no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, but it can already look like a network adapter
over its USB cable (that's how it's worked on in development). Something like
Over The Hare could run over that link: plug the Pixel into a computer and
open a page in the browser to add games, saves and audiobooks.

Much further down the line, once TortOS runs on the Pixel.

## Offer our kernel fixes upstream

Three things found on the way would help everyone running a Pixel 2, not
just us:

- **The screen's waits.** ROCKNIX's Pixel 2 device tree writes the panel's
  power-up waits as ordinary numbers, but the driver reads them as
  hexadecimal, so the screen takes 640 ms to power up where 280 were meant
  (boot-time.md, step 7). A one-file fix to their device tree.
- **The display starting in the background.** Our kernel patch 6 lets the
  display driver power the screen up while the rest of the boot carries on,
  instead of everything waiting for it (boot-time.md, step 9). This one is a
  bigger ask: it would go to ROCKNIX first, and maybe to mainline after.
- **The PX30's gamma table.** Our kernel patch 7 lets mainline use the
  display controller's gamma table on the PX30 (three lines, after the
  RK3506's), and the splash loads a correction for the Pixel 2's panel, whose
  red and green come out too strong (others had noticed the colors on the
  stock system too). The patch could go to mainline; the curve, red and green
  at 1.5, could go to ROCKNIX for whatever loads it there.

ROCKNIX takes changes as pull requests on GitHub.

## Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from a USB dongle

The Pixel 2 has no radio of its own, but a USB Wi-Fi or Bluetooth dongle is
known to work on it. TortOS asks the device file whether it has either radio
(plat_has_wifi, plat_has_bluetooth) and hides the rows that need one when it
doesn't. The Pixel's answers could check for an adapter instead of always
saying no, and the kernel would need the dongle's driver. Waiting on a dongle
to test with.
